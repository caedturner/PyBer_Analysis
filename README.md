# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

the purpose of this analysis is to analyze the ride sharing data provided and identify opportunities for future business stratigies to improve profit. The data we were given shows the ride information for rides in different city types (urban, suburban and rural) as well as the profit from the rides.
We categorized the data by city type and fare, and devloped a line graph ("Total Fare by City Type") to visualiuze our analysis.

## Results

#### Urban
The urban category accounts for:
  -  2,405 drivers.
  -  1,625 total rides. 
  -  $24.53 average fare per ride.
  -  $16.57 average fare per driver.
  - Total collected fares ($39,854.38).

#### Suburban
  -  490 drivers.
  -  625 total rides.
  -  $30.97 average fare per ride.

  -  $34.62 average fare per ride.

### Fare by City Type
The "Fare by City Type" line graph shows the differances over a four month period of time (January - April). The graph shows that over this nperiod of time Rural markets were the least profitable, Suburban are in the middle, and Urban are the most profitable. 

Urban
  - Most profitable week was the last week in February.
  - First week of January was the least profitable week.

Suburban
  - Most profitable week was the last week in February.
  - Second week of April was the least profitable week.

Rural
  - Most profitable week was the first week in April.
  - Second week of Jaunary was the least profitable week.

The Urban are overwhelmingly out performs both suburban and rural areas. 

## Summary
The information from our summary (above) tells us a lot about the different types of rides that take place in each city type. 

###### Rural
The average cost of a ride in the rural areas is the most expensive of the city types. 
  -  Run promotions or incitives targeted to this area could be effective in gaining valuable exposure. the exposure could lead to word of mouth, as well as retention. 
  - We could potentially look at zoning and reevaluate ride pricing for rural areas, especially since the average fare per ride and per driver are the highest of the city types. 
  - 
###### Suburban
Suburban city type has a high average fare per driver ($39.50), with only 625 drivers. 
  - We could start a campaign to enroll more drivers to help increase availibilty of rides and lower wait time for riders, which could make PyBer more accessable, which would increase profit. in this campaign we give enrolled (active) drivers %$15 off each ride they take, which would also increase demand and profit, as well as create word of mouth to the benefit of being a driver for PyBer.

###### Urban
Urban
The urban area is our most profitable area by a substabntial amount. Though, the average ride price is the lowest of all the city types.
  - we could create a interactive "Pyber Destination Exploration" promotion that is built into the app. We can partner with 20 different businesses spread throughout the metro area, make agreements with the businesses to give a percentage off if the customer Pyber to the location, and if you PyBer to 15 locations you gain a $25 gift card and 2 free rides with PyBer. Pyber to the strategic locations could increase ride time which would increase average cost per ride, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The Exploration could be fun and enguaging for the rider, and benefit the businesses we partner with in terms of marketing and profit.
